            <p>Viper is a late round specialist, getting most of her value out of vision obscuring and area denying abilities. For early rounds on defense, a pistol and a Snake Bite should be fine. You’ll need a little more thought in the later rounds once you can buy all abilities without them being at the expense of shields or weapons. Viper has one of the most unique ultimates in the game and requires her to play around it, literally and figuratively. Most often, the best time to use this ultimate is after you have planted the bomb. It obscures everything and forces the other team to push into your green death trap. The price of admission? All but one of your hit points.</p>

            <h2 class="highlight">Post plant</h2>
            <p>So the bomb has just been planted and you are outnumbered. Good thing you picked Viper. If there is one hero made for defending an already planted bomb, it’s Viper. Toxic screen and poison cloud are two abilities that can make pushing onto the site in any capacity a huge disadvantage for the enemy. A poison cloud over the bomb could add time to stall, as does using your Snake Bite on the bomb. Either from site or safely away, each ability either causes the enemy to slow down and reconsider their approach, or physically forces them off of your abilities. Lastly, and the real creme de la creme is Vipers Pit.</p>
